# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The kickstarter data set provided information about how an individual Louise started different fundraising campaigns she launched in different countries since 2009. 

The Goal column tells us how much money each campaign will need to succeed.
The Pledged column tells us how much each campaign actually made.
The Outcomes column tells us if the campaign met its goal.
The Country column lists the country in which the campaign was started.

### Purpose
We would be analyzing the data to provide various insights with regards to campaigns that succeded, failed, cancelled and are live and how they fared corelating to different goal criterias and funding targets.

## Analysis and Challenges
Please find below different analysis. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis is based on the Launch data for Parent Category 'Theater' since 2009.
By looking at the chart, on a monthly basis the count of successful campaigns get a sudden rise from March till May. 
The count dips starting from May until September only to see a slight increase October to drop till December. 
This trend stands equally true for the failed campaigns as well. 
Relatively the Cancelled campaigns remained low. 
Theaters also occupies the top spot for the highest number of succesfull campaigns compared to other categories.
