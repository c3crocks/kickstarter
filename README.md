# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The kickstarter data set provided information about how an individual Louise started different fundraising campaigns she launched in different countries since 2009. 

The Goal column tells us how much money each campaign will need to succeed.
The Pledged column tells us how much each campaign actually made.
The Outcomes column tells us if the campaign met its goal.
The Country column lists the country in which the campaign was started.

### Purpose
We would be analyzing the data to provide various insights with regards to campaigns that succeded, failed, cancelled and are live and how they fared corelating to different goal criterias and funding targets.

## Analysis and Challenges
Please find below different analysis. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis is based on the Launch data for Parent Category 'Theater' since 2009.
By looking at the chart, on a monthly basis the count of successful campaigns get a sudden rise from March till May. 
The count dips starting from May until September only to see a slight increase October to drop till December. 
This trend stands equally true for the failed campaigns as well. 
Relatively the Cancelled campaigns remained low. 
Theaters also occupies the top spot for the highest number of succesfull campaigns compared to other categories.

If we take look at the trend over years rise in pledges in Theater started from the year 2014 and contnued a similar trend year over year. 
From year 2010 to 2013 all campaigns have remained successful with 0 cancellation/failure.

Out of other Categories Journalism is an exception where all campaigns were cancelled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In the chart of Outcomes based on Goals, we are looking at the Sub-Category 'Plays'.
The chart shows that campaigns with a goal 'less than $1000' have shown the highest success rate of 75.81% trailing by goal category '$1000 to $4999' at 72.61%.
Failure percentage also has the same 2 categories fighting for the top spot with 'less than 1000' at 24.19%.
No campaigns were cancelled for plays sub-category.

We can conclude that category 'less than 1000' category to be more successful. 
However if we take a look at the count chart below we can observe that the category '$1000 to $4999' has higher number of campaigns even though it fell short to prove its caliber on the percentage chart. 
We can observe that better insights can be seen by showing the Outcomes by Based on Goal by counts.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	- Yes

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
