# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The kickstarter data set provided information about how an individual Louise started different fundraising campaigns she launched in different countries since 2009. 

The Goal column tells us how much money each campaign will need to succeed.
The Pledged column tells us how much each campaign actually made.
The Outcomes column tells us if the campaign met its goal.
The Country column lists the country in which the campaign was started.

### Purpose
We would be analyzing the data to provide various insights with regards to campaigns that succeded, failed, cancelled and are live and how they fared corelating to different goal criterias and funding targets.

## Analysis and Challenges
